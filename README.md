# Brazilian Employment Data Analysis

This is a small exercise using R to understand the behaviour of the Brazilian labor market for the past 5 years and a half.

## About the data

The data used here comes CAGED microdata, hosted on a private PostgreSQL Server.
CAGED stands for General Registry of Employed and Unemployed, in a free translation (original: Cagastro Geral de Empregados e Desempregados). It stores each hiring and each separation on formal jobs, countrywide, monthly. Several variables are available, such as economic activity of the company, education level of the person, and city.

For this work, I'll use only the average monthly wage and the number of people hired or separated in a given month.
